    Variable
    variable is a container that holds the value while java program is being executed

    3 Types od variable
    *local     => variable declared inside the body of a method is called local variable you can use it only within that method [local can not be defined with static]
    *instance  => variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method 
    *static    => it means that the variable belongs to the class itself rather than to any specific instance of the class

    operators in java
    Unary operator        => are the types that need only one operand to perform any operation like increment, decrement, negation, etc //
      // Main driver method
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Declaring a custom variable
        int n1 = 20;
 
        // Printing the above variable
        System.out.println("Number = " + n1);  // 20
 
        // Performing unary operation
        n1 = -n1;
 
        // Printing the above result number
        // after unary operation
        System.out.println("Result = " + n1);  // -20
    }
